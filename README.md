# Battleship AI

The game is played on a 8x8 grid. The human player places 3 ships ( horizontally or vertically ): a destroyer ( 2 squares ), a cruiser ( 3 squares ) and a battleship ( 4 squares ).

The application can be started from the main.py module. There are 2 user interfaces available : a text-based one and a graphical one. The choice can be made in the settings.txt file.

The AI is based on a probability map for the hunting mode and a simple algorithm that utilizes a stack for the targeting mode. The battleships are placed randomly for the computer player. The game does not indicate the moment a battleship has been sunk.
